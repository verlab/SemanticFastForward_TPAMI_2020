%> Functions to compute the Linear Locality Constrained reconstruction error and sparsity term.
%> 
%> Function call:
%> @code
%> [ total_error, reconstructionTerm , localityTerm ] = calculate_errors_LLC ( dictionary, representation, coeff, lambda )
%> @endcode

% ========================================================================
%> @brief Calculates the total error of the LLC minimization problem.
%>
%> The reconstruction error is calculate through calculate_errors.m. It is not possible to calculate the sparsity term of the LLC solution using the L1-norm, once the LLC always create a solution vector with norm equals 1.
%>
%> @param  dictionary     - d x M @c double , dictionary with M words in a d-dim space.
%> @param  representation - d x 1 @c double , video representation in a d-dim space.
%> @param  coeff          - 1 x M @c double , vector of M coefficients related to each of the dictionary bases.
%> @param  lambda         - @c double       , regularization constant used during the LLC processing.
%> @param  weights        - 1 x M @c double , vector of M weights related to each of the dictionary bases (video frames).
%>
%> @retval total_error    - @c double       , weighted sum of the terms.
