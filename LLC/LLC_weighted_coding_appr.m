% USAGE: [Coeff]=LLC_coding_appr(B,X,knn,lambda)
% Approximated Locality-constraint Linear Coding
%
% Inputs
%       B       -M x d codebook, M entries in a d-dim space
%       X       -N x d matrix, N data points in a d-dim space
%       knn     -number of nearest neighboring
%       lambda  -regulerization to improve condition
%
% Outputs
%       Coeff   -N x M matrix, each row is a code for corresponding X
